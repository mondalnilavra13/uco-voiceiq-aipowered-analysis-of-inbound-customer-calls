The call began with the RMSSQ agent, Mr. Ramesh, attempting to assist a customer, whose name was not provided during the conversation, with using their account for a pension account. The customer, who spoke in a language other than English, had difficulty communicating and could not provide clear information about their account or pension status. Mr. Ramesh tried to clarify the situation by asking if the customer had received a message about their pension account being credited, but the customer could not confirm this.

The customer mentioned that they had not received their pension for some time and were unsure if they had received a message about the credit of their pension account. Mr. Ramesh asked if the customer had tried contacting the bank regarding this issue and was informed that the customer had not been able to get through to the bank. The customer also mentioned that they had received a message on March 28th about their account being a credit sheet account, but they were unsure if the pension amount had been credited to their account.

Mr. Ramesh tried to gather more information from the customer about their account number, name, and date of birth, but the customer was unable to provide clear information. The conversation became confusing as the customer seemed to be having difficulty understanding the questions and providing clear answers. Mr. Ramesh attempted to clarify the situation by asking if the customer had received any messages about their credit limit being exceeded, but the customer could not confirm this.

The conversation continued with Mr. Ramesh trying to help the customer check their pension account details by suggesting they contact their branch or check their account online. The customer mentioned that they had checked with their branch and had not received any clarification. Mr. Ramesh also suggested checking the account details on UEM banking, N-banking, and PAN, but the customer could not provide the necessary information to do so.

The conversation ended with Mr. Ramesh advising the customer to contact their branch for clarification on their pension status and details. He also suggested that the customer try contacting the bank during working hours to speak with a representative. The call ended without a clear resolution to the customer's issue, and it is unclear if the customer received any clarification on the status of their pension account.

Throughout the conversation, the customer expressed frustration and confusion about their pension account status and difficulty communicating with the bank. Mr. Ramesh remained patient and tried to gather as much information as possible to help the customer, but the conversation became increasingly confusing due to the language barrier and lack of clear information from the customer.
