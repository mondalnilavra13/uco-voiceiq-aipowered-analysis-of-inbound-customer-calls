The call began with the customer expressing the need to speak in Bengali, which the agent did not understand. The customer requested to record the conversation, but the agent assured him that they could proceed in English. The customer then explained that he had deposited a check at the Shamsul School branch of Ucobank for a transfer of funds between two accounts. He had handed the check over to the AC manager at the counter, who had verified it and assured him that there were no issues with the cheque or the accounts. However, about 10-12 days later, someone from Ucobank called him to inquire about a recently deposited check. The customer was surprised as he had not deposited any check in the past few days. He asked for more information, such as the amount, cheque number, and signature of the person who had deposited the check. The bank representative was unable to provide these details and ended the call abruptly.

The customer expressed frustration and confusion about the situation and asked why the bank was asking him to pay for a check that he had not deposited. He also criticized the bank for not providing him with complete information and for being irresponsible in dealing with customers. The agent apologized for the inconvenience and explained that the customer had indeed deposited the check, but the amount had not been debited from the source account or credited to the target account. The customer confirmed that he had checked his account and had not received any funds.

The agent then asked for more details about the check, such as whether it was an inter-state check or a same-state check, and when it had been deposited. The customer clarified that it was a same-state check deposited on March 16th. The agent apologized again and explained that the maximum tenure for check clearance is three to five working days for same-state checks. However, the customer's check had not been cleared even after 15 days.

The agent suggested that the customer raise a complaint through the bank's complaint portal, as they did not have access to the details of the check or the account. The customer agreed and the agent provided him with the details of the complaint portal. The call ended with the customer thanking the agent and the agent wishing him a nice day. Throughout the call, the customer expressed frustration and confusion about the situation, while the agent apologized and tried to provide him with accurate information and next steps.
