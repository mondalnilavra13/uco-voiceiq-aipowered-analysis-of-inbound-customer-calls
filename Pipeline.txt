1. The code is ran on collab instead of jupyter as it needs high RAM and GPU for models like pynote and whispher.

2.All the code is in the "working_inbound_call_code"  txt file.

3. The "call_recordings" folder contain mp3 files which are in English.

4.Diarisation and Transcription is done on those mp3 files and the output is stored in the folder "transcriptions"

5.The diarised txt files in the "transcriptions" folder is copied and pasted in another folder called "diarized_speech"

6.Now we run the summarisation code and here the input folder is the "diarized_speech" folder containing the txt files and output of the summarisation is stored is "summarised" folder.
